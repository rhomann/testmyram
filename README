This program is a rather simple, yet effective test program for detecting
stability problems with your system's RAM. It is mainly targeted at small,
possibly MMU-less, systems which suffer from memory fragmentation and on
which better alternatives such as "Memtest86+" (http://www.memtest.org/) or
"stress" (http://weather.ou.edu/~apw/projects/stress/) are not available.

The testmyram program allocates memory in multiple blocks of fixed,
user-defined size in order to defeat the effect of memory fragmentation. In
each iteration, these blocks are filled with a sequence of pseudorandom
bits (unlike other program that fill memory with a single bit pattern,
typically of 32 bits length). After writing, and possibly after a
user-defined delay (bit fade test), the same sequence of pseudorandom bits
is generated again and compared with the content of the memory, possibly
multiple times.

The test may be started using multiple threads so to add a bit more stress
to the system.

Example:

$ testmyram -s 524288 -n 20 -j 2 -d 3600 -r 5 -v

This command starts two jobs, both allocating 20 blocks of size 0.5 MiB
each (for a total size of 20 MiB), fills these blocks with pseudorandom
bits, and checks their correctness five times in a row, while waiting one
hour before each read iteration. The program will run infinitely until
interrupted.

See the output of testmyram -h for complete usage information.
